// ðŸŽ¯ Task 2: FizzBuzz with Match Expression
// Implement the classic FizzBuzz problem using a match expression. 
// Iterate through numbers from 1 to 100, 
// printing "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, 
// "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5, 
// and "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by both 3 and 5. 
// For other numbers, print the number itself.
